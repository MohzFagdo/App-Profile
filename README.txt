*Instructions
This program will run all files inside a Mode folder in a chosen Profiles folder.
Mode folders are folders that contain the set of files to be run when the mode is picked.
The files can be executables, shortcuts, or folders - however executable folder names cannot contain a '.'

Mode folder names should start with a number followed by a '.' (eg. "1. Coding").
If multiple folders are found with the same number, an arbitrary one will be chosen.

You can change the path of the Profiles folder inside the program.
